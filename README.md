# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of predicting brain strokes using machine learning techniques. The project begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and underlying patterns. Following the EDA, two distinct scenarios for handling missing values and normalization were explored to preprocess the data effectively.
The initial phase of the project involved an extensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Various statistical and visual methods were employed to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and uncover potential outliers.
Two different approaches for handling missing values were implemented and compared. The strategies involved carefully imputing missing data points to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Several machine learning algorithms were employed to predict brain strokes based on the preprocessed data. Models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were implemented and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance.
Finally, the models' performances were rigorously evaluated and compared using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Comparative analysis provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model under different scenarios, aiding in the selection of the most suitable predictive model.
